// This file is intentionally empty.
// The update instructions are to check for and correct Zod import paths.
// Since there is no existing code, there are no Zod imports to correct.
// If this file were to contain Zod imports, they would be checked and corrected as follows:

// Example:
// If the file contained:
// import { z } from "zod/v4/core"

// It would be changed to:
// import { z } from "zod"
